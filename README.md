# dotfiles
:wrench: Yet another dotfiles repo...

## Setup

To use this repository as a start for your configuration files:
```sh
$ git clone http://github.com/marrakchino/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles
$ ./setup
# Let the program guide you
```

### One-liner alternative
```sh
$ git clone --recursive http://github.com/marrakchino/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles && sh -c ~/.dotfiles/setup
```

## Contributing

This may not be a collaboration-driven project but any contribution is welcome, especially concerning the `setup` file.
Corrections and typo fixes are encouraged.

# TODO 

* Add a -A option to `setup` in order to quickly overwrite all config files without ever being prompted
